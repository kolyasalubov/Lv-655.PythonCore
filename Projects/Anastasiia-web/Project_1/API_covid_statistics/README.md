Start gathering your own COVID statistics and keep up with the latest info

"API COVID Statistics App" project is created to fetch the latest total confirmed cases around the world.
The app provides you with your personal tools to track the tendency of COVID cases comparing it to the contries' population. The data can be updated every 24 hours.
The app can be also used to gather data about several countries in one file.txt.
Can be used for business to make forecast or for personal needs.
For example, before traveling on holidays check and track during the week the statistics to have more clear vision which country can have lockdown soon.
Make conclusions based on numbers.
